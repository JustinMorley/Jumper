# Unit 3 Jumper Project

This is a game called junper similar to hangman. The program takes a random word from a list of about 850 words and has you try to guess the letters of the random word. If you guess wrong a level of the parachute will disapear for the jumper, but if you get one right you will be one step closer to winning!
